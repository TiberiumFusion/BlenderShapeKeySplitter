# Shape Key Splitter for Blender
Split and merge shape keys, using a `MyShapeKeyL` `MyShapeKeyR` naming convention. Useful for separating and combining the left and right halves of expressions, such as eyebrow, eye, and mouth shapes. This isn't a super advanced addon, but it's far more functional than vanilla Blender's complete lack of an ability to do this.
* Split shape keys into left and right halves along a specified axis
* Merge left and right shape key pairs into single shape keys
* "Officially" compatible with Blender 2.78-2.79, but it should work on older versions (possibly up to 2.73).
